    <h2>FORMER WWE SUPERSTAR MAKES A POWERFUL DEBUT AT NJPW WRESTLEKINGDOM 18</h2>
    <p>Written by Sriman (1/5/2024)</p>
    <p>
        <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolph_Ziggler">Nic Nemeth</a></span> fka <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolph_Ziggler">Dolph Ziggler</a></span> made his surprise and subtle debut at New Japan Pro Wrestling's 
        premier annual pay-per-view WRESTLE KINGDOM 18. 
        The "Show-Off" appeared in the Tokyo dome in front of the 25,000 strong-style fans 
        in attendance alongside his brother and AEW wrestler,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Nemeth">"Hollywood Hunk" Ryan Nemeth</a>  
        right before the "WINNERS TAKES ALL" tag team match for the IWGP Tag Team Championship and 
        Strong Openweight Tag Team Championship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrillas_of_Destiny">Guerrillas of Destiny (Hikuleo and El Phantasmo)</a> and 
        Bishamon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirooki_Goto">Hirooki Goto</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi-Hashi">Yoshi-Hashi</a>) leaving the fans in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later on the show, after the inaugural IWGP Global Heavyweight Championship match, the 
        former WWE World Champion was confronted by the newly crowned Global Champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Finlay_(wrestler)">David Finlay</a>
        and involved in an all-out brawl seemingly hinting at a future feud for the New IWGP Global Championship.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the end of the spectacular pay-per-view, the two wrestlers once again found themselves in fisticuffs in the post-match media scrum
        with Nemeth gaining the upper hand. Nemeth then apologized to the Japanese media and audience for his reckless actions and
        talked about the pride and prestige of the new Global Championship and vowed that if he ever gets a chance to fight for the title, he 
        will show the world that the Championship is the pinnacle of success.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will Nic Nemeth sign with NJPW and challenge for the IWGP Global Heavyweight Championship? We will have to wait and see.
